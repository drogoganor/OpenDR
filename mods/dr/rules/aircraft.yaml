SkyBike:
	Inherits: ^Aircraft
	RenderSprites:
		Image: ufskbst0
	Tooltip:
		Name: Sky Bike
	Buildable:
		Description: Using a modified Spider Bike chassis, the Freedom\nGuard were able to produce cheap, fast aerial units\nwhich could attack enemy ground troops and other\nflyers. Although quicker than the Imperium Cyclone,\nthe Sky Bike is not as heavily armoured and is\noutgunned in even combat. The speed of the Sky Bike,\nhowever, allows it to dictate the circumstance of\nconflict. This unit fires high-velocity mini-missiles\nand, like the Outrider, must re-arm at the Re-Arming\nDeck.
