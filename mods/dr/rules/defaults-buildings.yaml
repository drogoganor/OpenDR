# Buildings
# There are two versions of each building, named "[Building].Constructing" and "[Building]".
# The .Constructing buildings have a SelfConstructing trait that turns the building into a new actor once built.
# The .Constructing buildings inherit an instance of ^SelfConstructingBuilding i.e. ^FactionBuilding.Constructing/^Headquarters.Constructing/
# ^TrainingFacility.Constructing/^AssemblyPlant.Constructing.
# The completed building "[Building]" inherits "[Building].Constructing" and also inherits a corresponding DrGenericBuilding/DrHeadquarters/DrTrainingFacility/DrAssemblyPlant.
