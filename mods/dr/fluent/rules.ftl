   Sniper is lethal against infantry targets. Like the
   Scout, the Sniper can morph into objects for
   camouflage.
   .name = Sniper

actor-scout =
   .description = Used mainly for front line surveillance, the Scout
   is able to morph into inanimate objects such as
   trees and rocks to conceal her position. The Scout
   is relatively fast but wears no body armour, so
   combat is not her speciality.
   .name = Scout

actor-medic =
   .description = The Field Medic can restore the health of wounded
   infantry units and administer an antitoxin to
   counteract the effects of the Amper. The Field Medic

   outfitted with a high-powered explosive device and
   then sent screaming into the enemy to die for the

   dissolve metal. They are very effective at attacking
   armour.
   .name = Exterminator

actor-infiltrator =
   .description = The Infiltrator can morph into enemy infantry and
   is able to steal plans for enemy units and buildings.
   The unit can also observe the opponent’s Minimap

   .description = These vehicles haul the vital resources that feed
   the ravenous war machine. The multi-purpose
   Freighter is able to carry fresh water or Taelon.
   .name = Freighter

actor-hoverfreighter =
   .description = Serves the same function as the Freighter, but its
   hover drive allows movement over a broader range of
   terrain types. It is armed with a laser cannon.
   .name = Hover Freighter

actor-spiderbike =
   .description = This all-terrain vehicle is the cornerstone of the
   Freedom Guard ground force. Fast and inexpensive,
   it is able to tackle all types of terrain. Armed
   with a double rail gun, it is fairly effective
   against armour but somewhat vulnerable to infantry.
   .name = Spider Bike

actor-rat =
   .description = The Freedom Guard troop transport has the ability
   to camouflage itself to match the surrounding terrain.
   The R.A.T. is unarmed, but is able to carry up to
   five infantry units at a time and can move over water,
   although at a considerably reduced speed.
   .name = Rapid Armored Transport

actor-skirmishtank =
   .description = The Skirmish Tank is the foundation upon which any
   successful military outfit is built. Properly
   accessorised, the Skirmish Tank can make a splash at
   an intimate midnight raid, a small summer skirmish,
   or even a full-scale gala massacre.
   .name = Skirmish Tank

actor-tankhunter =
   .description = This quick, deadly vehicle emits a massive short
   range electric discharge. The Tank Hunter is
   devastating in close combat but has no ranged weapon
   and is vulnerable in situations where it cannot close
   on its prey.
   .name = Tank Hunter

actor-phasetank =
   .description = Using limited phasing technology, the Phase Tank
   can bury itself underground in order to ambush
   enemy units. However, the Phase Tank must surface
   to move or fire and can be fired upon and take damage
   while submerged. Although the phased energy shield
   surrounding the vehicle serves to protect it and
   minimise damage, the Phase Tank is essentially
   defenceless while underground.
   .name = Phase Tank

actor-flakjack =
   .description = A revamped Construction Rig outfitted with two
   shoulder-mounted particle launchers. The Flak Jack
   salvages metal from the battlefield and converts
   it into microscopic metallic particles that it fires
   in clouds which cause sustained damage to air units.
   The unit has no defensive capability against ground
   attack, and should be protected at all times.
   .name = Flak Jack

actor-triplerailhovertank =
   .description = The pinnacle of Freedom Guard armour, the Triple
   Rail uses hover technology stolen from the Imperium
   to allow movement over a broader range of terrain
   types. Hauling three electro magnetic projectile
   accelerator cannons, or rail guns, this tank is a
   savage consumer of Imperium armour.
   .name = Triple Rail Hover Tank

actor-hellstormartillery =
   .description = The Hellstorm Artillery fires a long-range,
   area-effect explosive. Its range is more than four
   times longer than any other unit. A battery of
   Artillery is capable of single-handedly destroying
   an enemy base, but, the vehicle is slow and lightly
   armoured, so undefended Artillery is fodder in
   close combat.
   .name = Hellstorm Artillery

actor-shockwave =
   .description = A single-use unit that creates an immense earth wave
   that travels across the map, causing severe damage
   to everything in its wake. The unit is armed by
   double-clicking on it and then fired at an enemy
   target to determine the direction of the wave. The
   Shock Wave unit then embeds in the ground and
   detonates, self-destructing in the discharge. The
   Shock Wave is expensive and slow to build but well
   worth the wait.
   .name = Shock Wave

actor-watercontaminator =
   .description = This vehicle can pollute and permanently destroy
   freshwater springs. It is slow and extremely expensive,
   but once you have cut off your enemies’ resources,
   their ruin is inevitable.
   .name = Water Contaminator

actor-phaserunner =
   .description = The Phase Runner troop transport has the ability
   to travel while phased.
   .name = Phase Runner

actor-scoutrunner =

   laser and is fairly effective against both infantry
   and armour. However, it is not very sturdy, and is
   used primarily for front line reconnaissance.
   .name = Scout Runner

actor-itt =

   carry up to five infantry units at a time.
   .name = Invader Troop Transport

   is tough and packs a formidable plasma cannon. The
   Imperium overruns the enemy with endless waves of
   these ruinous machines.
   .name = Plasma Tank

actor-amper =
   .description = The Imperium's version of first aid, this lunatic
   cyborg fires darts into dying infantry units that
   boost the target’s health to full, but leave the
   unit poisoned so that its health will steadily
   decrease until the unit dies. The Amper can also be
   used as an offensive weapon, bringing slow death
   to enemy infantry.
   .name = Amper

actor-mad =
   .description = The M.A.D. fires bladed orbs at enemy air units.
   Like the Freedom Guard Flak Jack, it cannot fire
   at ground units and should be defended against land
   attack.
   .name = Mobile Air Defense

actor-shredder =
   .description = A huge, hovering nightmare, the Shredder tears through
   infantry like a runaway saw. Although it has no ranged
   attack, it is fast, heavily armoured, and inflicts
   severe damage on any infantry units foolish enough
   to get near it.
   .name = Shredder

actor-hostagetaker =
   .description = This diabolical Imperium vehicle snatches infantry
   units, lobotomises them and converts them into Suicide
   Zombies. Shortly after the infantry unit is run over
   and captured, it is released, now under the player’s
   control and with a high-powered explosive strapped
   to its back.
   .name = Hostage Taker

actor-tachiontank =
   .description = The Tachion Tank is the largest, most heavily armed
   beast on the battlefield. It’s a ponderous mountain
   of havoc that has the last word in any argument.
   When the enemy does manage to overpower one of these
   juggernaughts, it has the ability to self-destruct
   and take any nearby units down with it.
   .name = Tachion Tank

actor-scarab =
   .description = This long range weapon fires a fragmenting projectile
   that breaks into numerous burning particles over its
   target. This vehicle is slow and lightly armoured,
   but it can enclose itself in a retractable armoured
   exoskeleton when it gets in trouble. The unit cannot
   fire while this armour is engaged, but can weather
   a considerable beating while waiting for reinforcements.
   .name = S.C.A.R.A.B.

actor-skybike =
   .description = Using a modified Spider Bike chassis, the Freedom
   Guard were able to produce cheap, fast aerial units
   which could attack enemy ground troops and other
   flyers. Although quicker than the Imperium Cyclone,
   the Sky Bike is not as heavily armoured and is
   outgunned in even combat. The speed of the Sky Bike,
   however, allows it to dictate the circumstance of
   conflict. This unit fires high-velocity mini-missiles
   and, like the Outrider, must re-arm at the Re-Arming
   Deck.
   .name = Sky Bike

actor-outrider =
   .description = This ground attack aerial unit is slower and less
   manoeuvrable than the Sky Bike, but considerably
   tougher and fires air to ground missiles. Deadly
   effective against Imperium armour, it cannot engage
   other air units and should be escorted by air defence
   units. The Outrider has limited ammunition and must
   re-arm at the Re-Arming Deck.
   .name = Outrider

actor-recondrone =
   .description = This small unmanned drone is lightly armoured and
   has no offensive capability. It is used solely to
   scout enemy targets.
   .name = Recon Drone

actor-cyclone =
   .description = The Cyclone embodies the core of the Imperium aerial
   force. The unit is fairly rugged and can engage both
   air and ground units. However, the Cyclone’s neutron
   cannon has a limited energy source and must recharge
   at the Re-Arming Deck.
   .name = Cyclone

actor-skyfortress =
   .description = Death from above. This floating platform of wreckage
   houses the largest plasma cannon known to humanity.
   It's slow to recharge but makes a lasting impact.
